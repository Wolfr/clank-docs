I wanted to talk a bit about the updates to Clank the past few days and where things are going.

### What is Clank?

Since Clank is still relatively unknown allow me to repeat what Clank is. Clank is an open source HTML/CSS framework for prototyping mobile applications. It aims to provide HTML/CSS components that you can freely use in your projects. Think of it as Twitter Bootstrap but for prototyping native looking applications.

### Clank 0.1 aims

As mentioned before I am aiming to release Clank 0.1 by the end of the month. The main goal of the first release is to provide HTML/CSS for common components like form elements, buttons, button groups, headers and footers.

### Website updates

I've been working on the site so it's a nice place to go to for documentation. For example, go to <a href="/demos/table-view.html">the table view demo</a> to get a good idea of how you would read the docs for a component.

The main goal is a "professional" looking website so Clank looks like a project you can trust and can build your codebase on.

### Branding

I worked a little bit on the branding aspect: there is a logo now, there is a favicon. It's basic and not much but adds some visual flair. When this gets more popular I'll invest in a better logo - or maybe someone in the community is more talented in branding than I am.

Any feedback is welcome. If you have bugs, suggestions, questions, ideas - <a href="https://github.com/Wolfr/clank/issues">file a Github issue</a> or mention <a href="twitter.com/getclank">@getclank</a> on Twitter.
