I posted the link to Clank to [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=6232874) yesterday, which led to a nice visitor boost. I would like to highlight one of the questions in the discussion thread:

> The planned 0.2 release is delayed due to little public interest in Clank. -clank blog  
> Is user interest enough for the OP, or are you looking for other contributors?

To which I replied:

> User interest is enough but contributors would be better to raise the bar.

> I am specifically looking for someone with JS skills to handle building animation in between screens (similar to [push.js in Ratchet](http://maker.github.io/ratchet/#push)). This in turn is inspired by [jquery-pjax](https://github.com/defunkt/jquery-pjax).

> Explained in short - there should be some way to fetch the HTML for a "new page" replacing the older page without a page refresh. This way we can have nice CSS transitions between the pages. If we can plug the effects from something like [Effeckt](http://h5bp.github.io/Effeckt.css/dist/) in there this could lead to nice demo/prototype material and will also give the native coders a good idea about the animation.

> My speciality is UI design and CSS. My JS is not solid enough for framework quality javascript.

> The demo UI works with Angular.js

Obviously there is more interest in the framework than I thought. One of the biggest ways to improve it would be the "views" I am talking about in the above comment. So, if you are a JS coder and interested in contributing let me know.
