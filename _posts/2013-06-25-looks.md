My initial goal with Clank was to simulate the "native" look as much as possible. I wanted to make web apps that looked like native apps.

However, given the recent developments in mobile OS land (Firefox OS, iOS7) I decided it's better to provide a framework with good defaults that I can stand behind instead of chasing ever-changing platform looks.

Platforms will change but good UI design will stay. I'm aiming to provide a framework that can help create meaningful cross platform web apps like <a href="http://forecast.io/">forecast.io</a>. With the <a href="/documentation.html#skinning-mechanism">skinning mechanisms</a> in Clank you can quickly the look the way you want.

Here's a small video showing off the skinning mechanism:
