I am happy to announce that Clank 0.1 is released.

This release is focussed on providing basic functionality to create HTML prototypes for mobile devices. Download the release <a href="https://github.com/Wolfr/clank/releases">on Github</a>.

The next release (0.2) will be on August 20th. It will focus on improving the framework and documentation.

Regardless of the (low) version number I use Clank in commercial work myself so I wouldn't be afraid to use it, especially for prototyping work.

We are still looking for contributors. To get an idea of the things that need to be done, check out the issues on <a href="https://github.com/Wolfr/clank/issues?milestone=2&page=1&state=open">Github</a>.
