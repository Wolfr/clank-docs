<p>The demo is available at <a href="http://getclank.com/demo/">getclank.com/demo</a>.</p>
<p>Be sure to use Google Chrome to view it since otherwise it’s not pretty.</p>
<p>I’m using a lot of advanced CSS like <a href="http://css-tricks.com/">CSS calc</a> and Flexbox. This is intended to be a prototyping framework so for me it’s OK to make it work in a single browser. Over time support will improve as browsers improve.</p>
<p>Browser vendors are always asking for demos on why they need to implement some features. Well, here’s your demo!</p>
