* ChocolateChip-UI is an interesting framework that has the iOS7 look 'n feel, as well as Android and Windows Pone 8. See [their site](http://www.chocolatechip-ui.com/). Unfortunately the code is BSD licensed (unlike Clank which is MIT licensed)
* The 2 things that will make Clank better at this point are **page transitions** and **Android specific headers**
	* Work has started on animations but it could take a while given my current (client) workload.
* Contributions to Clank are always welcome - get in touch if you want to help! Post [issues on Github](https://github.com/Wolfr/clank/issues?milestone=none&state=open) on contact me directly.
