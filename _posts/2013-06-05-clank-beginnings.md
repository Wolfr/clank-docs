<p>This is the blog for the <a href="https://github.com/Wolfr/clank">Clank</a>&nbsp;open source project.</p>

<p>You might be wondering: WTF is Clank?&nbsp;Clank is an open source HTML/CSS framework for prototyping native apps. It’s a set of components that will help you communicate your design.</p>

<p>In theory you could use Clank to make a real app – but I wouldn’t recommend it. Browser support is minimal as Clank is used to convey the idea of an app to app developers.</p>

<p>I am looking for contributors to help with the actual website, documentation and testing the framework. Get in <a href="http://wolfslittlestore.be/contact/">touch</a>.</p>
