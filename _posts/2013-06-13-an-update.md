What happened in Clank world so far?

* The website got updated with a real blog which you are reading now. The <a href="http://getclank.wordpress.com/">Wordpress blog</a> had a very short life. RIP.
* Every post can be commented on. Using Disqus for the moment.
* For those people still using RSS (I know I do) there's an RSS feed to stay up to date. Subscribe using this URL: `http://getclank.com/atom.xml`.
* The demo section got updated. View the current demos <a href="http://getclank.com/demos/">here</a>. Note that things look best in Webkit based browsers. I recommend using Chrome for now. I am working on more support but want to find a balance between cutting edge CSS and browser support.
* iOS 7 was announced. I've been watching some of the #wwdc videos and I am <a href="http://wolfslittlestore.be/tasteless">not happy</a>. There are some good ideas in there but let's hope things improve visually with the final release. The interaction design is interesting, exploring the z-index. I hope to bring that to Clank so we have a good way to prototype native apps. Due to Apple's NDA I can't really talk about this as much as I'd like.
* I discovered a similar project to Clank called <a href="http://jaunesarmiento.me/fries/">Fries</a> that is alsor released under the liberal MIT license so some of that code might find it's way in this project (or the reverse)
* I set a date for the 0.1 release and it's going to be the *end of June*, so this month.

I am still looking for contributors to the project. File a <a href="https://github.com/Wolfr/clank/issues">github issue</a>, check out the code, let me know if you want to help.
